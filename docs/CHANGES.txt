Changelog
=========

4.0a2 - Unreleased
------------------

- moved "Manage portlets" fallback link out of main_template to 
  plone.manage_portlets_fallback viewlet
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9808
  [spliter]

- Point the "Join" action the newly-renamed @@register view.
  [esteele]

- Remove ``calendarpopup.js`` from jsregistry.xml. It no longer exists.
  [hannosch]

- Depend on ``plone.app.upgrade`` so it gets installed by default. Keeping
  the upgrade package separate only made sense when it had massively more
  dependencies than Plone itself. That cleanup isn't part of Plone 4.0.
  [hannosch]

- Added back an ``utranslate`` function to the i18nl10n module that retains the
  old call signature.
  [hannosch]

4.0a1 - 2009-11-19
------------------

- Moved ``Image Handling`` control panel into the main Plone category. It's not
  an add-on anymore.
  [hannosch]

- Clarified the default labels shown on the site setup overview page.
  [hannosch]

- Adjust tests to new Archetypes behavior, which respects the default language
  of the portal_languages tool.
  [hannosch]

- Adjust the _createObjectByType functions in utils and FactoryTool to use the
  _constructInstance method of the FTI instead of duplicating pieces of its
  logic.
  [davisagli]

- By default hide the "Subfolders" tab on collections. They don't behave in a
  way understandable to users. Existing sites aren't changed.
  [hannosch]

- Converted ``plone_javascript_variables.js`` to a browser page. Dynamically
  generating JS using a page template was too cumbersome. This also avoids the
  special ``escape_for_js`` handling of the translate script.
  [hannosch]

- "Relevance" was not internationalized in search_form.pt. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9747
  [vincentfretin]

- "Your Plone site is up to date" was not internationalized in plone-upgrade.pt.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9746
  [vincentfretin]

- "Preferences" link should go directly to the personal prefs, the memberprefs
  panel is an unnecessary abstraction here. Add-on products can easily add new
  links to the personal menu now, so that's the pattern we want to encourage.

- Removed the login portlet from the default setup now that the login link opens
  an inline window.
  [limi]

- Fixed a DYNAMIC_CONTENT in site_feedback_template.pt
  [vincentfretin]

- Make sure the 'Portlets: View dashboard' permission is set for Members.
  [davisagli]

- Make sure the mock MailHost used in tests is registered as a local utility
  so that it can be found via getToolByName.
  [davisagli]

- Moved all CSS styles to plonetheme.classic package. plonetheme.sunburst is
  now default theme, both are installed by default, classic theme may be
  uninstalled, sunburst theme can't be uninstalled. 
  [limi, naro]

- Added site_encoding and bodyClass methods to the @@plone view. These should
  simplify main template a bit.
  [naro]

- Avoid AttributeError while getting the CMF version for the
  plone_control_panel when enable-product-installation is off in
  zope.conf.
  [maurits]

- Fixed bad internationalized messages in logged_out.pt
  [vincentfretin]

- Changed default message for label_show_all msgid from "Show all..." to
  "Show all items" in livesearch_reply.py to be the same as in folder_contents
  view which use the same msgid.
  [vincentfretin]  

- Use the new ``pas_member`` view in the overview templates. This avoids
  getting the member info for each item in the listing from the PAS internals.
  [hannosch]

- registerNotify and mailPassword now send properly encoded emails.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9659
  [alecm]

- Deprecated register.py and join_form.cpt. This functionality has been moved 
  to plone.app.users.
  [esteele]

- Changed ``listActions`` on the workflow tool to no longer call the
  ``listGlobalActions`` method on every installed workflow. This method would
  internally call and calculate the worklist (reviewer_queue) for every
  workflow. The listActions method is called by the workflow menu to show the
  state drop down menu on almost all pages.
  [hannosch]

- Deprecated the ``selectedTabs`` script in favor of a method on the
  GlobalSectionsViewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Micro-optimize the CatalogNavigationTabs view.
  [hannosch]

- Added a more prominent upgrade warning to the top of the ZMI screen, instead
  of the old tiny note on the portal migration tool.
  [hannosch]

- Added a new ``@@plone-upgrade`` view, which replaces the old migration tool
  DTML ZMI screens.
  [hannosch]

- Added a simple ``advanced`` mode to the add site form. If advanced is passed
  as a query argument to the ``@@plone-addsite`` more options are available.
  The button in the ZMI uses the advanced mode by default. Currently the choice
  of omitting the default content and deselecting any of the default extension
  profiles are limited to the advanced mode.
  [hannosch]

- Expose the site language in the add site form and refactor the language
  guessing based on the browser language into that view. The addPloneSite
  function takes an explicit argument for the language now.
  [hannosch]

- Hardcode utf-8 for UnicodeSplitter, since Hanno says that's all we
  can accept and there's no way to use getSiteEncoding from the splitter.
  [alecm]

- Added option to skip the creation of the default example content in the new
  add site form. Grouped the add-ons selection via a fieldset.
  [hannosch]

- Refactored the old factory dispatcher / addPloneSiteForm to use a modern
  browser page instead.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the special default page and translation handling. LinguaPlone uses
  a content language negotiator per default instead.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced highlightsearchterms.js with the Plone trunk
  jquery.highlightsearchterms.js plugin. This removes the need to add
  searchterm= query parameters to search.pt results.
  Refs. http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8770
  [mj]

- Add a link to log out from the logged_out template if logged in as a Zope
  user via basic HTTP Authentication and the standard logout failed.
  [davisagli]

- Removed the cut/copy/paste icons from the action menu in new sites, as they
  just add noise + more HTTP requests.
  [limi]

- Moved happytalk in site_feedback_template.pt and author_feedback_template.pt
  to bottom of emails, per http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7001
  [jonstahl]
  
- Added precedence: bulk header to several PasswordReset's
  mail_password_template, per http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7000 - still
  haven't added this header to CMFPlone templates.
  [jonstahl]

- Added the upgrade warning to the main control panel screen. This is the same
  as found on the new overview page.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the new default overview page to be a normal browser page and made
  it aware of multiple Plone sites in the root or in ZODB mountpoints.
  [hannosch, davisagli]

- Overwrote the Zope quick start page, with a more helpful Plone specific
  version as already found in the unified installer.
  [hannosch]

- Turned the new add Plone site button in the ZMI into a link. This allows us
  to get out of the frameset to the top.
  [hannosch]

- Add jQueryTools integration, using plone.app.jquerytools.
  [smcmahon]

- Updated our add site ZMI screen.
  [hannosch]

- Changed search.pt (plone_forms) and rss_template.pt (plone_templates) so they
  display fullname instead of creator. 
  [ralphjacobs]

- Cleaned up old an unused scripts to edit the plone site object itself. This
  is done via the site control panel now.
  [hannosch]

- Hide the TinyMCE profiles hidden from the Plone site add form.
  [robgietema]

- Added 'Use site default' to the wysiwyg_editor field in the Personal
  Preferences view.
  [robgietema]

- Set default value of wysiwyg_editor to blank (use site default).
  [robgietema]

- Added default editor property to the site properties.
  [robgietema]

- Added TinyMCE and set TinyMCE as default visual editor.
  [robgietema]

- Removed getProductInfo method from the migration tool. It wasn't used
  anymore and depended on the persistent product registry.
  [hannosch]

- Inlined the enableSyndication function into importFinalSteps in
  setuphandlers. Avoid an unneeded catalog search.
  [hannosch]

- Simplified portal creation code and got rid of the PloneGenerator class in
  setuphandlers. It was a useless closure for independent functions.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the `plone-site` import step and stop overriding the
  `componentregistry` step. The portal object directly implements the
  IObjectManagerSite interface, so we don't need to activate it as a site
  manager in an extra step anymore.
  [hannosch]

- Updated and added various ZMI-visible tool titles.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the `plone-archetypes` import step. This is handled via a normal
  GenericSetup dependency in metadata.xml.
  [hannosch]

- Merged the `plone_various` import step into the `plone-final` step and
  install more packages directly by their profiles.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the zserverPatch. There's not many people running ZServer as the
  front-end web server anymore, so this isn't particular useful.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the default portlet blacklisting for the `Members` folder.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced Products.ATReferenceBrowserWidget with
  archetypes.referencebrowserwidget. This is PLIP 9258
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9258
  [tom_gross]

- Clarified help text for extension profiles on the add site form.
  [davisagli]

- Added a mechanism for specifying profiles that are selected by default on
  the add site form. This should be kept in sync with PloneTestCase's list
  of default extension profiles.
  [davisagli]

- Hide the plonetheme.sunburst uninstall profile from the add site form.
  [davisagli]

- Default to plonetheme.sunburst for new sites.
  [esteele, davisagli]

- Allow email addresses as login name, with a switch on the security
  panel. This is plip 9214: Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9214.
  [maurits]

- Extend the language specific default configuration to set a reasonable first
  day of week on the calendar tool.
  [hannosch]

- Stop pretending to use GenericSetup's content import. As a last item we now
  create the translated front-page purely in imperative code. As a bonus we
  moved the body text of the front-page to a page template, so i18ndude can
  automatically extract it.
  [hannosch]

- Create and configure `Members` folder purely in setupPortalContent.
  [hannosch]

- Converted import and export steps XML files to use ZCML registrations.
  [hannosch]

- Made sure to have a complete list of non-installable profiles. No longer
  apply the filter to base profiles and ignore our default profile. This works
  in combination with the corresponding changes in quick installer to reduce
  portal creation time.
  [hannosch]

- Make use of the new `authenticated` flag for ResourceRegistries entries 
  instead of specifying verbose condition expressions. 
  [hannosch]

- "Categories" are now "Tags", in line with common usage and terminology. 
  [limi]

- Changed workflow actor variable from user/getUserName to user/getId. 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7398.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the AT graphviz references action from all content types.
  [davisagli]

- Finished switching tool and action icons to use PNG format.
  [davisagli]

- Exclude some of the CMFDefault functionality, that isn't used or usable
  inside Plone sites. The CMFDefault types are no longer supported.
  [hannosch]

- Move prefs_users_overview and prefs_groups_overview pages to 
  plone.app.controlpanel (@@usergroup-userprefs and @@usergroup-groupprefs
  respectively).
  [esteele]
  
- Adjust to CMF's splitting of CMFCatalogAware into separate CatalogAware,
  WorkflowAware, and OpaqueItemManager mixins.
  [davisagli]

- Added zope.app.locales dependency, some strings are in zope domain such as
  'Invalid value' and '(no value)' found in portlet EditForm.
  [vincentfretin]

- Moved membershipRolemapping.dtml and portrait_fix.dtml to PlonePAS.
  [davisagli]

- Added icon_expr property to the Plone control panel tool actions, and
  switched to registering configlet icons here instead of in the action
  icons tool.
  [davisagli]

- Moved the diff tool registration to this package, so it can still be a tool
  for Plone 4.
  [davisagli]

- Use the new zope.ramcache in favor of zope.app.cache.
  [hannosch]

- Removed GroupUserFolder skin layers.
  [davisagli]

- Silenced the deprecation warning about old-style actions from CMFCore's
  ActionProviderBase when listing configlets with the control panel tool.
  [davisagli]

- Added the _IMREALLYPLONE4 hint to factory.py for PloneTestCase to use.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the calendar and review portlets from the standard global
  assignments. The review list is better put onto a personal dashboard and the
  calendar is exceptionally slow and rather user unfriendly. The news and
  events portlets are a better fit to show-case the portlets system.
  [hannosch]

- Include the `overrides.zcml` from `Products.PlacelessTranslationService` to
  actually make PTS' language negotiator available to the zope.i18n machinery.
  [hannosch]

- Got rid of the ToolNames indirection and declared the meta_types directly
  in the relevant tool class themselves.
  [hannosch]

- Moved ATCT specific exportimport code into the ATCT package itself.
  [hannosch]

- Made sure the plone.indexer registration works by introducing a more
  specific IPloneCatalogTool marker interface and registering the indexable
  object wrapper for this.
  [optilude]

- Added a restricted version of the opaqueItems method for CMFCatalogAware.
  This takes the idea of experimental.opaquespeedup one step further.
  [hannosch]

- Actually made the types tool action lookup optimization effective. Slightly
  optimized the add items drop-down menu.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the `ResourceRegistries` skin layer. It only contained test code.
  [hannosch]

- Make use of the new IContainer API of object managers and replace objectIds
  and objectValues calls.
  [hannosch]

- Finally removed the interfacePatch for the IContainer interface of
  OFS.ObjectManager after it has been merged upstream.
  [hannosch]

- Removed CMFTopic from our dependency list, it turns out that we aren't
  actually using any of it.
  [hannosch]

- Added proper deprecation warnings for the IBrowserDefault,
  IDynamicViewTypeInformation and ISelectableBrowserDefault interfaces, who
  has always come from Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI.
  [hannosch]

- Use the `replace_local_role_manager` method from borg.localrole. 
  [hannosch]

- Deprecate our own IOrderedContainer interface in favor of the original one
  from OFS.
  [hannosch]

- Avoid dependency on the zope.app.zapi package.
  [hannosch]

- Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
  of Globals.
  [hannosch]

- No longer depend on the PageTemplates.GlobalTranslationService but use
  zope.i18n directly.
  [hannosch]

- Merged in more performance optimizations from experimental.contentcreation.
  We don't restrict the permissions for the temporary folder anymore, but
  only care about the permissions of the actual target folder.
  [hannosch]

- Use the new `icon_expr` for specifying icons for content types instead. 
  [hannosch]

- Prefer path expressions over Python expressions for persistent expressions.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the content_status_history form to include the required content table. 
  The old_folder_contents template is gone. 
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the browserDefault tests to use actual traversal to look up views
  for content items instead of relying on Acquisition.
  [hannosch]

- Moved the `scale_image` function from utils into the PlonePAS.utils
  module, as PlonePAS is the only user of it.
  [hannosch]

- The remaining functionality from GroupUserFolder has been merged into
  the PlonePAS package. GroupUserFolder is no longer required.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the groups, groupdata, membership and memberdata tools from this
  package. All code is now in a central place inside PlonePAS. The persistent
  tools have been from the PlonePAS package since Plone 2.5.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced has_key method calls with containment checks via `in`.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced a direct interface invocation with a queryAdapter call, to avoid
  an internal getattr call and make the pattern clearer.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced here with context in all templates and scripts. The old spelling is
  still supported, but we need to settle on one to avoid confusion.
  [hannosch]

- Optimized the types tool action lookup further to avoid Acquisition lookups.
  [hannosch]

- Simplified the normalizeString method.
  [hannosch]

- Optimized the action lookup code and implemented category restriction for
  the types tool in the same way it was available for the actions tool.
  [hannosch]

- Removed remaining sys.modules hacks to provide the browser.ploneview as
  browser.plone.
  [hannosch]

- Removed last unused external methods and PloneInitialize code. To my
  knowledge the Windows installer doesn't use this code anymore.
  [hannosch]

- Write the doctype definition in the main_template in a way that does not
  claim to be valid XML, as the main_template really isn't.
  [hannosch]

- Worked around `sys._getframe` call in mark_view.
  [malthe, hannosch]

- Removed macro slot for changing the document type; this was not
  correct XML and should this flexibility be required, it's
  recommended to customize `main_template.pt`.
  [malthe]

- Turned deprecated string 'Unauthorized' exceptions into real exceptions.
  [davisagli]

- Removed module alias for the ploneview formerly named plone. 
  [hannosch]

- Clarified content language versus response language handling.
  [hannosch]

- Removed unmaintained and unused Favorite content type.
  [hannosch]

- Removed our own home-grown dependency checking code.
  [hannosch]

- Exposed option to honour exclude from navigation even in subfolders from
  navtree_preferences.  Request from theming sprinter at ploneconf2008.
  [MatthewWilkes]

- Made the fieldset tabbing code faster on startup (especially for IE) by 
  constructing a big string and creating the HTML elements in one bunch 
  instead of using DOM functions to add them step by step. 
  [fschulze]

- Added uniqueItemIndex as a method to the plone view. 
  [hannosch]

- Added back ``global_defines.pt`` as a template including the (empty)
  macro definition. This allows main templates to be compatible with both 
  Plone 3.x and 4.0 at the same time. 
  [hannosch]

- Removed ``global_defines.pt`` and the globalize-hack. Templates 
  now bring in their tool and function dependency using the 
  standard utility views or via normal Acquisition of tools.
  [malthe, hannosch]

- Fixed test for editing language fields. This refs 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8342. 
  [hannosch]

- Removed deprecated context parameter in getDefaultPage and 
  isDefaultPage in utils.py. 
  [maurits]

- Made sure the export order of the factory tool GS step is consistent. 
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7892. 
  [hannosch]

- Replaced lock_icon with smaller version with one third of the size. 
  [hannosch]

- Removed backwards-compatibility code in calendar_formfields.js introduced 
  in Plone 3.1.4. Any date-time picker not based on calendar_macros.pt 
  using the old-style (no plone.jscalendar namespace) methods will no 
  longer work until adjusted. 
  [mj]

- Don't show relevance information of one percent in the search form,
  since sort_on searches will always show this for all entries
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4325
  [hannosch]

- Removed duplicated isMemberIdAllowed method from registration tool.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed mailto link in event view and enhanced the spam protect script to
  allow setting css ids on the generated anchor tag. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8219
  [hannosch]

- Fixed contact form to be usable for authenticated users which have no
  email address stored in their member data. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5766
  [hannosch]

- Avoid empty tags in the contact form. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8182
  [hannosch]

- Avoid an empty div in login_form. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8192
  [hannosch]

- Avoid an empty dd in recently modified.pt. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8186
  [hannosch]

- Avoid an empty span in folder_summary_view. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8181
  [hannosch]

- Changed wording in personalize form to remove reference to external
  editor icon and add a note about ZopeEditManager. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7390
  [hannosch]

- Changed webstats_js in portal properties to a text field.
  This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7781
  [hannosch]

- Added option to the error log control panel to search for an error log
  entry by number, since the number is the only thing that is exposed to
  normal users. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7234
  [hannosch]

- Changed title of collections control panel to plural form. This
  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8096
  [hannosch]

- Include link to the plone.org upgrade manual from the migration tool 
  inside the ZMI. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8075
  [hannosch]

- Clarify help text in content_status_history. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8218
  [hannosch]

- Let default RSS list publication date, not modified date and include 
  the body text. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7952
  [hannosch]

- Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of 
  properties. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6005
  [hannosch]

- Fixed invalid markup in membershipRolemapping.dtml. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6222
  [hannosch]

- Removed long unused getObjPositionInParent.py script which wasn't 
  functional at all anymore, since it used Zope 2 interfaces. Also 
  simplified the getObjPositionInParent function in the CatalogTool. 
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6081
  [hannosch]

- Removed getActionObject call from createObject script. It was a private 
  method and would always fail. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7172
  [hannosch]

- Removed testing of sendto action visibilty from sendto.cpy. There's a 
  permission to use to restrict sending mail. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5377
  [hannosch]

- Disable external editor icon for structural folders. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6871
  [hannosch]

- Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of zip or 
  plone since this shadows the views by those names. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6105
  [hannosch]

- Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility. 
  [elro]

- Make use of upgrade steps with a source '*' version and an explicit 
  destination, to register the 'enable site' and 'register tools as 
  utilities' only once.
  [hannosch]

- Added support for upgrade step groups to the migration tool and started 
  exposing the individual upgrade methods as steps. 
  [hannosch]

- Changed the way messages are handled during migration. We don't pass an 
  `out` list around anymore, but use the logging framework. 
  [hannosch]

- Replaced our own migration step registration by using GenericSetup steps 
  directly. Changed the migration tool to integrate with GS instead. 
  Added BBB code to read the instance version from the migration tool if 
  the last profile version isn't set yet inside the GS tool. 
  [hannosch]

- Exposed all our migration steps as GenericSetup upgrade steps.
  [hannosch]

- Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface 
  for our own code. 
  [hannosch]

- Use png icons instead of gif icons since they are much more flexible 
  for styling.
  [dannyb, wichert]

- Fixed the coreVersions method in MigrationTool to return strings and not 
  bound methods for the Zope and Python version. 
  [hannosch]

- Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This closes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610
  [hannosch]

- Moved all icons for real actions from the action icons tool to the
  actions themselves.
  [hannosch]

- Changed PloneTool's getIconFor method to prefer the icon expression set 
  on the action itself instead of looking it up in the action icons tool. 
  This finally makes use of the new icon expression on actions introduced 
  in CMF 2.1. 
  [hannosch]

- Avoid unneeded line breaks in TAL output, by effectively disabling the 
  internal beautified wrapping inside tags. This reduces the HTML output 
  by 5% - 10% for normal Plone pages. 
  [hannosch]

- Memoize the installed products and packages in App.FactoryDispatcher 
  for the duration of the process runtime. 
  [hannosch]

- Hiding page history, page navigation, and busy icon (spinner) in print.css 
  Related to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7433 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7402
  [siebo]

- Updated webdav_enabled method in utils.py to check for 
  webdav.interfaces.IWriteLock interface in addition to the old Zope2 
  interface. 
  [hannosch]

- Use a FauxArchetypeTool which returns no catalogs for CatalogMultiplex 
  aware objects in portal factory. This prevents most temporary objects 
  from being indexed in the first place. 
  [tesdal, hannosch]

- Move our GenericSetup import step registrations to zcml. 
  [wichert]

- Added a 'do-not-use' warning to the ZMI security screen for Plone content 
  objects. Sharing tab or workflows are what you are looking for. 
  [hannosch]

- Moved interface declarations for factorytool from ZCML to the class. 
  [hannosch]

- Added BBB code for ITranslatable, which is now part of LinguaPlone. 
  [hannosch]

- Added an explicit button to add a new Plone site to the ZMI for faster 
  access. If you have installed Plone this is probably what you want to 
  add most of the time. The button only shows up in the root folder. 
  [hannosch]

- Deprecate the ITranslatable interface. This interface is LinguaPlone- 
  specific and has thus been moved to LinguaPlone. 
  [wichert]

- Removed tests for isRTL method of PTS. The method was deprecated in the
