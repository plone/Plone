Changelog
=========

3.3rc1 - UNRELEASED
-------------------

 - Fixed msgid label_event_byline default message which contained dynamic content.
   Created a label_event_byline_without_location used when you don't specify
   location in an Event.
   [vincentfretin]

 - Updated the custom indexes in CatalogTool.py to no longer depend on the
   'portal' keyword or kwargs, both of which are gone from plone.indexer.
   This is done in an effort to be forward-compatible with CMF 2.2. See
   the plone.indexer README for more details.
   [optilude]

 - Fixed the registerIndexableAttribute() backwards-compatibility shim to
   register named adapters.
   [optilude]

 - Re-added the 'getRemoteUrl' and 'link_remote' attributes of the navtree
   decorator, which were lost during the implementation of PLIP 126.  Note
   that these attributes are deprecated and will not be available in Plone 4.
   Custom navigation templates using these attributes should simply link to
   the Link object, whose default view now takes care of redirecting based on
   the value of the global 'redirect_links' property.

 - Make the Groups Overview search post back to the same page, since it displays a
   lot more useful information than the prefs_user_group_search, and fits more
   with the way the Users Overview works. Include a "Show all" button as well.

3.3b1 - March 12, 2009
----------------------

- Replace the workflow history portlet with a content history portlet
  for newly created sites. This implements PLIP 243.
  [wichert]

- Changed most actions to now use the globals_view/navigationRootUrl. Updated
  the CMFCalendar tool override to allow the calendar portlet to allow passing
  in kwargs such as path.  Fixed skin templates and scripts to use the
  @@plone_portal_state/navigation_root_url instead of portal_url.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
  [calvinhp]
 
- Removed CatalogTool.ExtensibleIndexableObjectWrapper in favour of the
  wrapper in plone.indexer, and made registerIndexableAttribute() a deprecated
  facade for registering an IIndexer adapter. See plone.indexer for more
  information about the correct (and more robust) way to register custom
  indexers.
  [optilude]

- Removed the `Reinstall` button from the `Add/Remove products` control panel.
  Users would constantly mistake it as an upgrade mechanism, which Plone does
  not yet support in a structured way.
  [hannosch]

- Added an option in the Site Settings configlet to disable TTW locking
  entirely.  Also fixed a couple bugs with unlocking and made it so the
  lock gets refreshed as long as an editor is on the edit page.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/240

- Added a 'redirect_links' site property and corresponding 'Redirect
  immediately to link target' setting in the types configlet (for the Link type
  only).  The default view for the Link type has been changed to
  link_redirect_view.py from the plone_content skin layer, which redirects or
  falls back to the old link_view depending on the 'redirect_links' value.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/126
  [davisagli]

- "Mark external links" and "External links open in new window" were not working
  independently ('mark' had to be set for 'new window' to work) and marking could
  not be turned off at all (#7383). Fixed by having either one enable the js
  support and adding a new site property to control marking. Implemented so
  that new site property will be assumed false if missing and created on change
  if missing -- so no migration required. There is a matching change in 
  plone.app.controlpanel.
  [smcmahon]

- PLIP 238: Disable inline editing for new Plone sites.
