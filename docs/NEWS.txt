Changelog
=========

Plone 4.0 - UNRELEASED
----------------------

- Removed unmaintained wicked.
  [hannosch]

- Removed long unmaintained external editor support.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed missing define for portal in the prefs_user_memberships template.
  Fixes part of http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8468
  [garbas, calvinhp]

- Made the fieldset tabbing code faster on startup (especially for IE) by
  constructing a big string and creating the HTML elements in one bunch
  instead of using DOM functions to add them step by step.
  [fschulze]

- Added uniqueItemIndex as a method to the plone view.
  [hannosch]

- Added dependency on plone.keyring and load its GS profile, so we get a
  default KeyManager utility.
  [hannosch]

- Added back ``global_defines.pt`` as an empty template including the
  macro definition. This allows main templates to be compatible with both
  Plone 3.x and 4.0 at the same time.
  [hannosch]

- Removed ``global_defines.pt`` and the globalize-hack. Templates
  now bring in their tool and function dependency using the
  standard utility views or via normal Acquisition of tools.

  [hannosch]

- Replaced lock_icon with smaller version with one third of the size.
  [hannosch]

- Don't show relevance information of one percent in the search form,

  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4325.
  [hannosch]

- Moved the standard portlet assignments and blacklists to the content
  profile, since otherwise the content they apply to does not exist yet
  when they are run.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

  normal users. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7234.
  [hannosch]

  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8096.
  [hannosch]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6222.
  [hannosch]

- Removed long unused getObjPositionInParent.py script which wasn't
  functional at all anymore, since it used Zope 2 interfaces. Also
  simplified the getObjPositionInParent function in the CatalogTool.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6081.
  [hannosch]

  method and would always fail. This closes

  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

- Disable external editor icon for structural folders. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6871.
  [hannosch]

- Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of zip or
  plone since this shadows the views by those names. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6105.
  [hannosch]

- Remove hardcoded [ ] around current page number. Instead add a currentPage
  class to the containing span so you can style it properly using CSS.
  [wichert]

- Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
  [elro]

- Make use of upgrade steps with a source '*' version and an explicit
  destination, to register the 'enable site' and 'register tools as
  utilities' only once.

- Added support for upgrade step groups to the migration tool and started
  exposing the individual upgrade methods as steps.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the way messages are handled during migration. We don't pass an
  `out` list around anymore, but use the logging framework.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced our own migration step registration by using GenericSetup steps
  directly. Changed the migration tool to integrate with GS instead.
  Added BBB code to read the instance version from the migration tool if
  the last profile version isn't set yet inside the GS tool.
  [hannosch]

- Exposed all our migration steps as GenericSetup upgrade steps.
  [hannosch]

- Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface
  for our own code.
  [hannosch]

- Use png icons instead of gif icons since they are much more flexible
  for styling.
  [dannyb, wichert]

  new extension profile for fullscreen.
  [spliter]

- Added normal actions for a newly structured control panel.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the coreVersions method in MigrationTool to return strings and not
  bound methods for the Zope and Python version.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610.
  [hannosch]

- Moved all icons for real actions from the action icons tool to the
  actions themselves.
  [hannosch]

- Changed PloneTool's getIconFor method to prefer the icon expression set
  on the action itself instead of looking it up in the action icons tool.
  This finally makes use of the new icon expression on actions introduced
  in CMF 2.1.
  [hannosch]

- Deprecated PloneFolder and BasePloneFolder. The TempFolder used in the
  FactoryTool was the last place which used it and uses the much simpler
  PortalFolderBase from CMFCore now.
  [hannosch]

- Avoid unneeded line breaks in TAL output, by effectively disabling the
  internal beautified wrapping inside tags. This reduces the HTML output
  by 5% - 10% for normal Plone pages.
  [hannosch]

- Memoize the installed products and packages in App.FactoryDispatcher
  for the duration of the process runtime.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed document_view to only compute the main text of the page once.
  [hannosch]

- Removed backwards-compatibility code in calendar_formfields.js introduced
  in Plone 3.1.4. Any date-time picker not based on calendar_macros.pt
  using the old-style (no plone.jscalendar namespace) methods will no
  longer work until adjusted.
