Changelog
=========

3.3 - Unreleased
----------------



3.3rc1 - March 30, 2009
-----------------------

- New favicon.ico that is in line with the new branding.
  [limi]

- author.pt: Fixed the #region-content mess, replaced modification date with
  created date (as that's what the table says it's listing), reduced to 5 items
  instead of 30 tables with 5 items each, made the table vertical.
  [limi]

- batch_macros.pt: Added "current" class to current item, removed the brackets, 
  added ellipses. Moved comments to a tal section to stop them from showing up 
  in the source.
  [limi]

- default_error_message.pt: Turned apostrophes into real apostrophes.
  [limi]

- join_form.pt: Removed unnecessary fieldset.
  [limi]

- logged_out.pt: Removed duplicate "new account" section (it's actually located 
  in the login form).
  [limi]

- login_form.pt: Moved Forgot/New out of the fieldset, fixed wording + added 
  headline.
  [limi]

- main_template.pt: Moved #content to main template instead of offloading its
  responsibility to the individual templates. This makes it easier to avoid 
  duplication and make it possible to use it with Deliverance and similar 
  theming approaches.
  [limi]

- personalize_form.pt: Cleaned up the #content mismatch. No more double tabs.
  [limi]

- search_form.pt: Removed unnecessary fieldset, inserted "searchform" id on 
  form to not get it filled in as id="search" automatically.
  [limi]

- Updated the custom indexes in CatalogTool.py to no longer depend on the
  'portal' keyword or kwargs, both of which are gone from plone.indexer.
  This is done in an effort to be forward-compatible with CMF 2.2. See
  the plone.indexer README for more details.
  [optilude]

- Merged `safe-upgrade-button` branch. Instead of the removed `Reinstall`
  button in the `Add/Remove products` control panel, we now have an upgrade
  button for all products whose installation is driven by GenericSetup. This
  is based on GenericSetup upgrade steps.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed msgid label_event_byline default message which contained dynamic content.
  Created a label_event_byline_without_location used when you don't specify
  location in an Event.
  [vincentfretin]

- Updated the custom indexes in CatalogTool.py to no longer depend on the
  'portal' keyword or kwargs, both of which are gone from plone.indexer.
  This is done in an effort to be forward-compatible with CMF 2.2. See
  the plone.indexer README for more details.
  [optilude]

- Fixed the registerIndexableAttribute() backwards-compatibility shim to
  register named adapters.
  [optilude]

- Re-added the 'getRemoteUrl' and 'link_remote' attributes of the navtree
  decorator, which were lost during the implementation of PLIP 126.  Note
  that these attributes are deprecated and will not be available in Plone 4.
  Custom navigation templates using these attributes should simply link to
  the Link object, whose default view now takes care of redirecting based on
  the value of the global 'redirect_links' property.
  [davisagli]

- Make the Groups Overview search post back to the same page, since it displays a
  lot more useful information than the prefs_user_group_search, and fits more
  with the way the Users Overview works. Include a "Show all" button as well. 
  [esteele]


3.3b1 - March 12, 2009
----------------------

- Replace the workflow history portlet with a content history portlet
  for newly created sites. This implements PLIP 243.
  [wichert]

- Changed most actions to now use the globals_view/navigationRootUrl. Updated
  the CMFCalendar tool override to allow the calendar portlet to allow passing
  in kwargs such as path.  Fixed skin templates and scripts to use the
  @@plone_portal_state/navigation_root_url instead of portal_url.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
  [calvinhp]
 
- Removed CatalogTool.ExtensibleIndexableObjectWrapper in favour of the
  wrapper in plone.indexer, and made registerIndexableAttribute() a deprecated
  facade for registering an IIndexer adapter. See plone.indexer for more
  information about the correct (and more robust) way to register custom
  indexers.
  [optilude]

- Removed the `Reinstall` button from the `Add/Remove products` control panel.
  Users would constantly mistake it as an upgrade mechanism, which Plone does
  not yet support in a structured way.
  [hannosch]

- Added an option in the Site Settings configlet to disable TTW locking
  entirely.  Also fixed a couple bugs with unlocking and made it so the
  lock gets refreshed as long as an editor is on the edit page.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/240

- Added a 'redirect_links' site property and corresponding 'Redirect
  immediately to link target' setting in the types configlet (for the Link type
  only).  The default view for the Link type has been changed to
  link_redirect_view.py from the plone_content skin layer, which redirects or
  falls back to the old link_view depending on the 'redirect_links' value.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/126
  [davisagli]

- "Mark external links" and "External links open in new window" were not working
  independently ('mark' had to be set for 'new window' to work) and marking could
  not be turned off at all (#7383). Fixed by having either one enable the js
  support and adding a new site property to control marking. Implemented so
  that new site property will be assumed false if missing and created on change
  if missing -- so no migration required. There is a matching change in 
  plone.app.controlpanel.
  [smcmahon]

- PLIP 238: Disable inline editing for new Plone sites.
